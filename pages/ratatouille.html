    <h5><em>Ratatouille</em> dish prepared in the style of the Disney Pixar film of the same name.</h5>

    <p>Ratatouille (/ˌrætəˈtuːi/ RAT-ə-TOO-ee, French: [ʁatatuj] (listen)), Occitan: ratatolha [ʀataˈtuʎɔ] (listen), is a
    French Provençal dish of stewed vegetables, originating in Nice, and sometimes referred to as ratatouille niçoise
    (French: [niswaz]).[1] Recipes and cooking times differ widely, but common ingredients include tomato, garlic, onion,
    courgette (zucchini), aubergine (eggplant), capsicum (bell pepper), and some combination of leafy green herbs common to
    the region.</p>
    <p>In 2007 Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios released the film Ratatouille. The film features Remy, a young
    rat with an exceptional sense of taste and smell who dreams of becoming a chef. The climax of the film sees Remy prepare
    the titular dish in the form of confit byaldi for the notoriously harsh food critic Anton Ego, who unexpectedly loves
    the dish due to childhood nostalgia for his mother's cooking. The movie gave widespread exposure to this meal in
    American culture and around the world.</p>

        <li>2 zucchinis</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><em>Sauce</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>salt, to taste</li>
        <li>pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>28 oz can of crushed tomatoes (795 g)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, from 8-10 leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><em>Herb Seasoning</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, from 8-10 leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fresh thyme</li>
        <li>salt, to taste</li>
        <li>pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven for 375˚F (190˚C).</li>
        <li>Slice the eggplant, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini into approximately ¹⁄₁₆-inch (1-mm) rounds, then set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch (30-cm) oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion, garlic,
        and bell peppers until soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add the crushed tomatoes. Stir until
        the ingredients are fully incorporated. Remove from heat, then add the basil. Stir once more, then smooth the surface of
        the sauce with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Arrange the sliced veggies in alternating patterns, (for example, eggplant, tomato, squash, zucchini) on top of the
        sauce from the outer edge to the middle of the pan. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Make the herb seasoning: In a small bowl, mix together the basil, garlic, parsley, thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil.
        Spoon the herb seasoning over the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover, then bake for another 20 minutes, until the vegetables are
        softened.</li>
        <li>Serve while hot as a main dish or side. The ratatouille is also excellent the next day--cover with foil and reheat in a
        350˚F (180˚C) oven for 15 minutes, or simply microwave to desired temperature.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
